<h1 align="center">Welcome to The Who Api</h1>

<p>• Hi to Everyone, this is a pretty simple Api made in Codeigniter where i list The Top 34 The Who's Uk Singles</p>
<p>• If You want to check the Sql database go to Assets Folder, and take a look at the Txt archive named Sql DataBase</p>
<p>• Also, the expected result can be seen in the Assets Folder, in the Json Archive Named theWho</p>
<p>• You are Free to add any The Who Song, or fix anything Wrong and then make a pull request at GitHub</p>
<p>• The Default Url to make the Requests is (your Localhost)/Api_TheWho/index.php/theWho</p>
<p>• By the Way, i am using Xampp, so maybe in the Program that you use, you don't have do write the /Api_TheWho</p>
