Welcome to The Who Api
###################

Hi to Everyone, this is a pretty simple Api made in Codeigniter where i list The Top 34 The Who's Uk Singles
If You want to check the Sql database go to Assets Folder, and take a look at the Txt archive named Sql DataBase
Also, the expected result can be seen in the Assets Folder, in the Json Archive Named theWho
You are Free to add any The Who Song, or fix anything Wrong and then make a pull request at GitHub
The Default Url to make the Requests is (your Localhost)/Api_TheWho/index.php/theWho
By the Way, i am using Xampp, so maybe in the Program that you use, you don't have do write the /Api_TheWho
